# EagerForm

A vanilla javascript form validation library based on HTML5 constraints with support for custom rules, messages and localizations.

## Story
I'm not a JS developer, in fact I haven't wrote or even dared to write a JavaScript library before this one. But when I needed a vanilla JS form validation library that has customization, localization and support for custom rules, I just couldn't find one that does what I want. There are tons of form validation libraries out there. I tried almost all of them, before I begin to write this, so this is strictly opinionated and not suitable for everyone. I strictly wrote this based on my needs, but I still left the room to modify the options to customize it.

## Features

- HTML5 based vanilla JS form validation
- Support for custom rules
- Support for custom messages (can be defined globally or even set inline)
- Data attribute/JS options based debouncing for inputs
- Data attribute/JS options based delaying for inputs
- Focusing/scrolling to the first error
- Extensive options to customize almost every behavior of the library

## Drawbacks
- Highly opinionated
- Not unit tested
- Support for modern browsers only
